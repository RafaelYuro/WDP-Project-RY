        PEMDAS is a acronym for how to solve mathematical expressions that have multiple operations. 
        It stands for parenthesis (P), exponents(E), multiplication (M), division (D), addition (A), and subtraction (S).
        Each one of them is a mathematical operation. Some math expressions only have 1, some have more, some have all 6.
        The acronym is the order in which you do the operations. You would do what's in the parenthesis first.
        Next, you solve the exponents. From there, it gets tricky. 
        With multiplication and division, you don't do all multiplication first and then division.
        You do solve those from left to right. For example, you have "3x4/2x10" you do 3x4/2x10=12/2x10=6x10=60.
        If you do, 3x4/2x10=12/2x10=12/20=3/5, that's wrong.
        Then finally, you do the same for addition and subtraction. Not all addition first, then subtraction.
        You solve from left to right, like before with multiplication and division.
        One example of all of PEMDAS, 4x4-16/2+(3+9)^2=4x4-16/2+(12)^2=4x4-16/2+144=16-16/2+144=16-8+144=8+144=150.
        Here, you will do mini games to practice the different parts of PEMDAS. 
        Once you've done that, you will unlock the main PEMDAS game. The goal here is to master PEMDAS.
