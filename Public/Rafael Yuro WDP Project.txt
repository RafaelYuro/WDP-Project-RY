	For my project (the purpose), I want to create a math game that teaches PEMDAS. It would involve an assortment of minigames (key features) that teaches the different parts to PEMDAS: parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction. 
Then, there would be a main game where you have to use all of PEMDAS to play.
	Addition and subtraction game: A game that would involve scales and balancing different weights.
	Multiplication and division game:
	Parentheses game: 
	Exponent game:
	Main game, PEMDAS battle: card game (unlockable cards)
	People who need help with learning math are the intended people who this game is for.
	They would be able to sign up, make a character, earn clothing for their character the more they play, keep an eye on their progress when learning.
